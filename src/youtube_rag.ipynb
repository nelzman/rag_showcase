    "### What are LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence models capable of understanding and generating human-like text.  \n",
    "They are trained on vast amounts of data to learn the patterns and structures of language.  \n",
    "LLMs utilize deep learning techniques to process input text and generate coherent responses, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can LLMs do?\n",

    "#### Read\n",
    "You can give it a text and it can summarize it or categorize it (p.E. sentiment):  \n",
    "![GPT can read](../artifacts/images/youtube_rag/gpt_reading.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables quite a view use-cases like categorizing reviews, translating text or summarizing large amounts of text.\n",

    "You can ask it to create text:  \n",
    "![GPT can write](../artifacts/images/youtube_rag/gpt_writing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables use-cases like content creation, brain-storming for ideas or \n",
